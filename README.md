# Project1
A C++ based text and emoji encryption–decryption project focused on learning real-world project structure, file organization, input handling, and core logic flow. Built as a learning-first project to improve repository understanding, debugging skills, and practical C++ development.

## Project Idea

The idea is to build a C++ application that:
- Takes text input from the user, including emojis.
- Converts the text into an encrypted, random-looking string.
- Allows the encrypted text to be copied and pasted anywhere.
- Decrypts the encrypted text back to the original text correctly.

This project is not focused on strong cryptography.
Instead, it is designed to help understand:
- How a C++ project is structured
- How multiple files work together
- Program flow from `main()` to helper functions
- Input handling, strings, and buffers
- Debugging and repository navigation

## Future Scope

- Improve the encryption logic
- Add better error handling
- Support different input methods
- Integrate with a browser extension (planned separately)

## Project Status

Currently in the initial setup and learning phase.
The project will evolve step by step as understanding improves.
